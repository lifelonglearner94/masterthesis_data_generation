# Physics Configuration for Kubric Data Generation
# =================================================
# This file defines the parameter ranges for physics simulation

# Video specifications
video:
  resolution: 256
  num_frames: 16
  fps: 30             # Output video frame rate (previously it was 20)
  simulation_fps: 240  # Internal simulation rate

# Camera settings
camera:
  angle_degrees: 45
  distance: 14.0     # Increased to see larger arena
  focal_length: 35
  sensor_width: 32

# Environment
environment:
  floor_texture: "generate_grid_image/black_grid.png"  # Path relative to repo root
  # Floor texture tiling settings for visible grid in physics simulations
  floor_texture_tiling:
    enabled: true       # When true, texture tiles/repeats across floor
    scale: 3.0          # Number of tiles across floor (3 = ~4 meter grid cells for 12m arena)
  ambient_light: 0.3
  key_light_intensity: 1.0

# Dynamic object
object:
  # Available object types from KuBasic asset source:
  # Primitives: cube, cylinder, cone, sphere, torus
  # Complex shapes: suzanne (Blender monkey), teapot (Utah teapot), gear, spot (quadruped)
  # Additional: torus_knot, sponge
  # Note: 'cube' and 'sphere' use native Kubric primitives; others use KuBasic assets
  types: ["cube", "cylinder", "cone", "torus", "suzanne", "teapot", "gear", "spot"]
  size_range: [1.1, 1.5]  # Random size between these values
  mass_normal: 2.5        # kg (used in Phase A_1 and A_2 - normal/in-distribution)
  mass_ood: 1.1           # kg (used in Phase B - out-of-distribution)
  # Initial position of the cube (XY is centered around (0, 0))
  #
  # Notes:
  # - Values are in meters in world coordinates.
  # - The sampler will clamp these ranges so the cube always spawns inside the arena.
  # - If omitted, defaults to spawning in the central 30% of the arena.
  initial_position:
    # Option A (explicit ranges):
    x_range: [-1.0, 1.0]
    y_range: [-1.0, 1.0]
    # Option B (alternative): comment out x/y ranges and use a fraction of the arena size.
    # xy_fraction_of_arena: 0.15

# Friction settings
friction:
  # Normal distribution (for Phase A_1 and A_2)
  normal:
    min: 0.99
    max: 0.99
  # Slippery / OOD distribution (for Phase B)
  slippery:
    min: 0.00
    max: 0.00


# Force impulse settings
force:
  # Magnitude range (Newtons) - tuned for ~1 second of visible motion
  magnitude_min: 12
  magnitude_max: 13
  # Direction constraints (applied on XY plane only - 2D force)
  apply_at_frame: 1  # Apply force between frame 1 and 2


# Dataset phase configuration
# Phase A_1: Random mass, normal friction (training)
# Phase B: Fixed mass, slippery/OOD friction
# Phase A_2: Fixed mass, normal friction (continuation)
dataset:
